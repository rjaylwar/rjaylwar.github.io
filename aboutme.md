Hello! I am RJ, a android developer with nine years of experience. I started my career working for [Bandsintown](www.bandsintown.com) and 
most recently spent two and a half years working at [Instacart](www.instacart.com). This blog is mostly a place for me to jot down things
I frequently have to google :laughing:. Currently I am based out Jackson, Mississippi where I live with my wife who is a pediatrician.
